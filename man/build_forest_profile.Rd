\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame that represents field or simulated forest inventory data.}

\item{height}{Name of the column containing the heights of the trees.}

\item{diameter}{Name of the column containing the dbh or base diameters of the trees.}

\item{label}{A column with the labels that identifies the trees (scientific names or other taxonomic identification).}

\item{string}{The string or the column of the strings that contains the turtle graphics instructions, created by \code{iterate_lsystem} function. If NULL (default), the \code{tree_model} argument will be used.}

\item{tree_model}{The tree model to be used when \code{string} = NULL. Can be an integer or the name (character) that refers to the desired tree model. Check the \code{fractal_tree_model} function help for more details. Default is "binary_tree".}

\item{n_iter}{Integer. The number of iterations to build the selected \code{tree_model} when \code{string} = NULL (default). Default value = NULL means it depends on the selected \code{tree_model}. Check the \code{fractal_tree_model} function help for more details.}

\item{angle}{Numeric. The angle in degrees when a change in direction is requested.}

\item{crown_diameter}{Crown diameter of the plant.}

\item{h_reduction}{Numeric. Reduction rate to be applied to the length of the branches whenever the symbols '(' and ')' appear in the string. Default is the golden ratio.}

\item{d_reduction}{Numeric. Reduction rate to be applied to the diameter of the branches whenever the symbols '(' and ')' appear in the string. Default is the golden ratio.}

\item{randomness}{Logical. Should randomness be applied to the angle of the branches?}

\item{angle_cv}{Numerical. The coefficient of variation of the angle, used when \code{randomness} = TRUE. Default is 0.1.}

\item{length_cv}{Numerical. The coefficient of variation of the length, used when \code{randomness} = TRUE. Default is 0.1.}

\item{leaf_size}{Size of leaves (branches from the ends of the plant). Default is NULL (follows the applied d_reduction value).}

\item{sample}{Logical. Whether to sample rows (individuals) from the \code{data}. If FALSE, the entire \code{data} will be used. Default to TRUE.}

\item{n_trees}{Integer. The number of trees to be sampled from \code{data} when \code{sample} = TRUE.}

\item{dist}{Numerical. The average linear distance between the trees.}

\item{dist_cv}{Numerical. The coefficient of variation of the \code{dist}argument. Default is .3.}

Build a 2D Forest Profile of L-System Trees Based on Inventory Data
}
\details{
A column of \code{data} can be declared in the \code{string} argument. In this case the column must contain for each line (tree) the turtle graphics string that builds the tree.
